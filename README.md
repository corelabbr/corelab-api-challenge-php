You are tasked with building a web application that allows users to create and manage their to-do lists. The application should consist of a responsive webpage built in React, and an API built in PHP Laravel to store and manage the to-do lists.

### The repositories
The [frontend repository](https://github.com/corelabbr/corelab-challenge-web-app-php)

If you feel more comfortable, you can pick another React framework and show us your skills.

The [backend repository](https://github.com/corelabbr/corelab-api-challenge-php)

If you feel more comfortable, you can pick another PHP framework and show us your skills.
